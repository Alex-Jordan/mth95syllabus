You can use it to send an e-mail to me and\/or your classmates.  Please include a relevant subject in the header of your e-mail. The subject should include the class you are taking (including the course number and CRN) and the topic of your message. For example, you email subject line might be: [MTH 95 - CRN 40023]: Help with Section 10.1 Homework Writing an email subject this way helps me get back to you quickly. Sometimes I get a hundred emails in just one day, and I want your emails to be the ones I prioritize.  If your question\/comment would be of interest to other students, please consider posting it to the General Discussions area instead. Then I can publicly answer your question, and the entire class might benefit.  We can also meet over Zoom to talk through anything you' like to talk about.    Responses from Your Instructor  I will reply to your emails and discussion posts within 48 hours, and often much sooner. If you send me a message in the evening, it's more likely that I won't reply until the following day. Please don't wait until the evening an assignment is due to reach out to me for help, or else I might not be able to reply until it is too late.    Discord  This course has a Discord server, and I recommend that you join. If you have never used Discord before, what matters is that I think it is a great way for you (as an online student) to form connections with other students in the class. You are not required to join Discord, but please give it a try. You should receive an invitation from me over email. That invitation eventually expires, so if you waited too long, just send me a message so I can send you a new invitation.   "

  "body": " Weekly Routine  This course is arranged with a weekly modular design. Each week, students should complete all assignments listed in the week's module . On a week before an exam, things are different: there is also a preparation assignment for the exam.  Modules officially start and end at 10:00 on Sundays. Often you will have early access to a weekly module. And after each week, you retain access to old modules until the term ends.  Your week begins by:   Reading assigned sections from the textbook and trying the embedded Checkpoint exercises. You will be asked in D2L to verify that you did this.    Watching the recorded video lessons. This simulates attending an in-person lecture. While watching the video lessons, you'll take notes using the video lecture outline notes that are provided in the module. You will scan and upload these notes for each module.   You may read from the book and then watch the videos, or vice versa. It depends on your learning style. But you should read and watch the videos before you proceed to homework assignments.   You have two forms of homework:   Online homework in WeBWorK that is automatically graded. You should try to complete these on your own, but you are welcome to reach out to me or a tutor for help.    Worksheets where you will write your explanations and solutions in full. You may work on these alone, but you will have a dedicated study group that you can work with too. In fact, for all worksheets before the first midterm, you are required to collaborate with your study group to earn full credit.   These assignments are due Sundays at 10:00 . Please start early and work often on these tasks throughout the week. They take time for you to learn the content in a way that you will hold onto it.  All assignments for a weekly module are due at 10:00pm Sunday night. Assignments cannot be completed or turned in late. Exceptions can be made if you've had a medical or family emergency, but in general there won't be an exception to meeting the weekly deadline. In the past I accepted assignments late, and I found that this enabled students to put off work for the course until it snowballed into something that was impossible to complete in time. So I want you to understand going into the course: complete your assignments each week ahead of the due date so that you won't have zero scores.  Throughout the week, consider reaching out for help in the following ways:   the General Discussions area in D2L    contacting people in your study group    free tutoring from PCC at    contacting me over email     "

To avoid being marked as a no show :   All activities from Module 0 must be completed by Thursday at 10:00 pm on the first week of class. Module 0 in D2L states the details of what is required.    Module 1 is where actual academic content for the course begins. All Module 1 assignments (video lecture notes, WeBWorK , and a worksheet) are due Sunday night at 10:00pm. You must complete at least one of these assignments by the Sunday night deadline. (Of course you should complete them all, but to avoid being marked no show , completing one is enough.)     Students in this course are expected to enter the course several times a week. Class announcements are posted on our D2L course landing page, and it is your responsibility to read these announcements.  Check your pcc.edu email daily. I sometimes send important information in mass emails to the class. It is your responsibility to read these messages as they come. Also I may be replying to a message that you initiated, and I am only permitted to contact you using your pcc.edu email address.  If you are not going to take exams using remote proctoring on the official exam dates with the rest of the class, then you have responsibilities to make other arrangements according to . These arrangements need to be in place at least one week ahead of the exam.  Make an honest effort to collaborate with your partners on the worksheet assignments. As this is an asynchronous class, and everyone has different schedules and outside responsibilities, it is not always possible. But it can be rewarding to make connections with the handful of people in your group.  Reach out to me or a tutor early when you are having trouble with a topic. Your responsibility is to recognize when you need this help. We can make a plan to help you if we have enough time. We might meet over Zoom or in person, whatever we need to do.  "

You should use Firefox, Chrome, or Safari as your web browser.  A computer\/laptop that you use for this course must have the Zoom desktop client installed in order to take the remote proctored exams. A phone\/tablet that you use for this course must have the Zoom mobile app installed for the same reason. It is not enough to use Zoom through a web browser. Check if you have Zoom installed on your device(s) and if you do not, see Zoom's website for instructions on how to install it. If this is an obstacle, please reach out to me to get help overcoming it.  For the remote proctored exams, you must either:   use a computer with a detachable webcam; or    be able to connect to the exam Zoom session twice: once with your computer and once with a phone or tablet that has a camera.   Please understand that with one screen you will be viewing the exam while connected to Zoom and sharing your screen. Then some sort of camera needs to separately be streaming your workspace area. It is impossible to use a camera that is embedded in that first screen for this purpose.  We will use free graphing calculator apps called GeoGebra and Desmos . (You may choose which one you prefer).  You should have access to a printer to print the video lecture notes and worksheets. Or if not, you should be comfortable with digitally annotating a PDF using a tablet or something similar. In the end, you have to post your written assignments in D2L: either scanned from paper or written digitally in the first place.  You should have access to a scanner or scanning app to upload completed video lecture notes, weekly worksheet assignments, and your exam work. Even if you do the video lecture notes and weekly worksheets digitally, you will still have to scan your paper work during exams. Adobe Scan (with accessibility resources ) is a free smartphone app for scanning documents that you could use. There are many other similar apps you could explore. With a scanning app, you take multiple photos with your phone, then click something when you are done. And the app produces a single PDF file with each picture on its own page.  "

Post them to the appropriate place in D2L each week. The video lecture note files are available in D2L, from the Quick Reference navbar item, in Downloads .    Online Homework (25%)  You have online homework for each section using WeBWorK . See for details. The due date for each assignment is posted in WeBWorK . Usually, more than one section will be due at the same time. You should start working on a homework assignment soon after the class that is associated with that section of the book. But always read the textbook section, watch the video lectures, and complete the video lecture notes before beginning WeBWorK .    Worksheets (25%)  Each week there is a worksheet to complete and turn in. You are encouraged to work with your group partners on these assignments (using Discord, Zoom, email, whatever works), and check each other's work before turning yours in. Always complete the WeBWorK before starting the worksheet.    Exams (20% + 20%)  There is a midterm exam and a final exam. Each exam is proctored. Most students will use remote proctoring and take the exams from home, with a video feed that shows your work area. See for possible alternative arrangements.

You may submit answers any time before the due date.   Late Work  Late work with WeBWorK is not accepted. (If you had a medical or family emergency, reach out to me.) However if you complete enough of your WeBWorK , you will earn a reward that allows you to reopen one assignment from the past for 24 hours.     Emailing for Help  When you are stumped, you can click the Email Instructor button at the bottom of any problem. Write a message explaining what you have tried and if possible, include the work from your calculations. WeBWorK will send me (your instructor) an email with helpful information (like all of the incorrect attempts you have tried) and I will get back to you soon with a response. When I respond, it will be via email, so you must remember to check your email.    Math Achievements  As you complete more problems, you win badges for various achievements . For example, the On One Hand badge is for completing a homework set with fewer than five incorrect submissions. Both earning badges and just plain answering questions correctly will earn you achievement points . As you gain more achievement points, you will level up. Each time you level up, you earn an item that can be used to affect your grade.    "

If you'd like to trade your time slot, let me know. It's probably OK, I just have to make sure that not too many students take a remote procotred exam at the same time.  You need to arrive 30 minutes early, as noted above. There is a check-in procedure where we make sure your work area is acceptable and you have the technology issues ironed out. The check-in procedure includes showing a photo ID (PCC student ID card, driver's license, passport, military ID, ) to confirm your identity while taking these exams. Plan to arrive in the Zoom session 30 minutes early for the check-in procedure.   These sessions are almost 2 hours long. However you may need less time than that. Some students complete these exams in under an hour.   What is virtual proctoring ?  Please take some time to read the Student Guide to Virtually Proctored Exams in Zoom . This explains what a virtually proctored exam is like better than I can.  We will practice the setup for a virtually proctored exam ahead of time. I will arrange for a session when many of us can practice. For others, we can meet individually or in smaller groups over Zoom to practice.    Alternatives  If you cannot participate in the remote proctored exams as described above (maybe you do not meet the technology requirements, have an unavoidable scheduling conflict, or just prefer to take exams in person) there are some alternatives. However, please note that there are no exceptions to having to take the exams with a proctor. If you need to explore the alternatives below, please contact me as soon as possible to begin discussing your options. The alternatives include:   You identify a proctoring institution (such as another college) that is closer to where you live. You will be responsible for making proctoring appointments with them two weeks in advance of the exam dates. I will provide you with a form This form is linked from our D2L course at the bottom of the Content menu. that you complete with the assistance of that institution's testing center. You may take an exam a few days earlier than the dates listed above, but not later.    You have an AEDR accommodation for extended time or a private working area. Then you will work with PCC AEDR at least one week in advance to schedule appointments for these exams. These might be in-person or remotely proctored, as is appropriate for your needs. You may take an exam a few days earlier than the dates listed above, but not later.    If you have a scheduling conflict, you can make an appointment with a PCC testing center for a virtually proctored exam. Visit (Proctored exmas) to arrange an appointment. Once it is scheduled, contact me to tell me about your appointment.     If you simply prefer to take your exams in person, you can make an appointment with a PCC testing center for an in-person proctored exam. Visit (Proctored exmas) to arrange an appointment. Once it is scheduled, contact me to tell me about your appointment.    You may contact me if you have some situation that is not covered here and you would like to ask about it.   By registering for this course, you agree to all of the above. By default, you will take an exam using remote proctoring over Zoom at the scheduled time. Or you will plan at least one week in advance for one of the alternative arrangements.  The midterm exam and the final exam will each be worth 20% of your final grade.  "
