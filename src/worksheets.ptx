  <p>
    Each weekly module (for modules 1 through 8) has a worksheet assignment. There are several
    purposes of these assignments:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ask questions that are too complex for <webwork/> to assess automatically.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Allow me to review your <em>process</em> for finding answers, so I can make sure that you
          do not have a fundamental misunderstanding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Develop your ability to <em>explain</em> how to reach an answer, which is something that
          an online homework problem cannot do.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Give our online course a sense of community, since you will be encouraged to work together
          in a small group.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    During the first week you will use a D2L discussion forum to find a group to work with through
    the term. You should organize yourselves according to what times of the week you are available.
    Some students can only work together in the evenings, some in the mornings on weekends, etc.

    <title>Late Submissions</title>
    <p>
      Worksheets have a due date in D2L. Completing them by the due date helps you stay on pace to
      be successful. They are due at 10:00 <pm/> on Sunday evenings, just like the other assignments
      (video lecture notes and <webwork/>) for the week. Late submissions will not be accepted and
      the score will be zero. (Reach out to me if you had a medical or family emergency.)
