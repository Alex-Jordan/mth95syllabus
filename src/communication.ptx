    <title>Contact Your Instructor</title>
    <p>
      The best way to contact me is by using the D2L Brightspace e-mail system from the D2L
      Classlist area. You can use it to send an e-mail to me and/or your classmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please include a relevant subject in the header of your e-mail. The subject should include the
      class you are taking (including the course number and CRN) and the topic of your message. For
      example, you email subject line might be:
      <cd>[MTH 95 - CRN 40023]: Help with Section 10.1 Homework</cd>
      Writing an email subject this way helps me get back to you quickly. Sometimes I get a hundred
      emails in just one day, and I want your emails to be the ones I prioritize.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your question/comment would be of interest to other students, please consider posting it
      to the General Discussions area instead. Then I can publicly answer your question, and the
      entire class might benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also meet over Zoom to talk through anything you' like to talk about.

    <title>Responses from Your Instructor</title>
    <p>
      I will reply to your emails and discussion posts within 48 hours, and often much
      sooner. If you send me a message in the evening, it's more likely that I won't reply until the
      following day. Please don't wait until the evening an assignment is due to reach out to me for
      help, or else I might not be able to reply until it is too late.

    <title>Discord</title>
    <p>
      This course has a Discord server, and I recommend that you join. If you have never used
      Discord before, what matters is that I think it is a great way for you (as an online student)
      to form connections with other students in the class. You are not required to join Discord,
      but please give it a try. You should receive an invitation from me over email. That invitation
      eventually expires, so if you waited too long, just send me a message so I can send you a new
      invitation.
