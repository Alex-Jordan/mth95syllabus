    The two exams are proctored. We will use <q>remote proctoring</q> where you take the exam from
    home (or wherever) and we will use Zoom to allow me to monitor your workspace. For details, see
    <xref ref="section-exams"/>. The most important thing for now is to plan to be somewhere on the
    exam dates that is quiet and comfortable, with a strong internet connection on a device that has
    Zoom installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is possible to take your exams in-person, or proctored remotely at an alternate time. But
    these arrangements need to be made at least one week in advance. See <xref ref="section-exams"/>
    for details.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will meet with you over Zoom as needed, and frequently invite you to meet with me that way. If
    you are struggling with any topics from the course, completing assignments, or studying for the
    exams, let's meet over Zoom and talk about it.
